## Difference between front-end and back-end

**The front-end** is the part of the website that the user sees and directly interacts with.

**The back-end**, or the "server-side", is much more behind-the-scenes and is basically how the site works, updates and changes. 

## How it works if I type "javascript" and press enter on Google

1. The web browser creates a request and sends it to the Google server.
2. As soon as the server gets the request, the software programs "spiders" start by fetching web pages including the word "javascript". 
3. Google's algorithm decides what to show first and then returns them in order.
4. The results are sent back to the web browser as the response.
5. The web browser displays the results to the user.
